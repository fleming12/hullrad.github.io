HullRad is an algorithm for calculating hydrodynamic properties of a macromolecule from a structure file.
A webserver to run HullRad on your macromolecule can be found at (http://52.14.70.9/).

To run HullRad on your local machine as a Python script, download the file HullRadV[?].py and read the header for instructions on installing the necessary libraries. 

If you publish work that uses HullRad please cite the following reference: Fleming, P.J. and Fleming, K. G., HullRad: Fast Calculations of Folded and Disordered Protein and Nucleic Acid Hydrodynamic Properties. Biophysical Journal, Volume 114, Issue 4, p856â€“869, 27 February 2018.
