HullRad is an algorithm for calculating hydrodynamic properties of a macromolecule from a structure file.
A webserver to run HullRad on your macromolecule can be found at (http://52.14.70.9/).

To run HullRad on your local machine as a Python script, download the file HullRadV9.py and read the header for instructions on installing the necessary libraries. 

HullRadSAS is similar to the original HullRad but it also provides the amount of two types of macromolecular hydration, shell and entrained. Version 1.1 fixes a bug that overestimated Dmax and affected rotational diffusion calculations.

Download the Python script, Display_hull.py (Python2) or Display_Hull3.py (Python3), to draw convex hull around a displayed structure in PyMOL.

Other scripts to run HullRad in batch mode are available at the HullRad website.
